# Dome Keeper (PC-Steam)

## Where is the settings page?

The [player settings page for this game](../player-settings) contains all the options you need to configure and export a
config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Every upgrades in the second half of your keeper, dome and primary gadget are locked and shuffled.
An additionnal tech tree is in game to unlock items
Switches can be found in cave to unlock items

## What items and locations get shuffled?

Buying an archipelago upgrade or finding a switch checks that location
Items are an upgrade unlock or an extra cobalt gain

## Which items can be in another player's world?

Any of the items which can be shuffled may also be placed into another player's world.
Every upgrades are considered as "useful" and extra cobalt as "filler", for items dispatching

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

When the player receives an item, you'll see the unlock displayed on the top left of your screen.
If you are viewing the tech tree while you obtain an unlock, it should be unlocked live on the tech tree window.

## What happens if a player dies in a run and I have Death Link active?

When a player dies, your dome will instantly break just like if you actually lost your game (unless you have the relic)
You can freely restart a game, and you'll be able to restart a game with all unlocks you previously had.
Any items found in an earlier run will not be sent again if you encounter them in the same location.

## Caves looks a bit different when restarting, why?

This is due to the game not having proper seeding generation, so you may encounter ores at different locations even when
restarting the same game.
